# crashdumper
python scripting that wraps microsofts kd (windbg) to extract information from crashdump files (*.dmp)

The first release https://github.com/janwilmans/crashdumper/releases also contains the otherwise very well hidden
windows 7 version of windbg / kd and friends as extracted from the SDK installer.
